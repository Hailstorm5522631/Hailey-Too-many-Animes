      <p>Twisted Wonderland is an game, manga, and anime that consists of characters in collage founded off of Disney villians. There are seven houses/dorms based off of a Disney Villain. Twisted Wonderland takes place in a collage called Night Raven Collage (aka the NRC) and their Rival is known as Royal Sword Achademy, RSA, where Disney heroes founded the dorms. Each character has a unique magic that is known as a signature spell. It is developed by the user's interest and power. The Hall of mirrors is the only place that is actually on campus. Inside the Hall of Mirrors, there are mirrors that act as a portal to the other dorms, each house with their own mirror.</p>
        <p> The house known as Heartslabyul (Pronounced  Hearts-lay-byul) was off from the Queen of Hearts', from "Alice in Wonderland", spirit of stricness. This house consists of five main characters, Riddle Rosehearts, Ace Troppla, Deuce Spade, Trey Clover, and Cater Diamond. Riddle Rosehearts is a second-year Housewarden, which is the equivilant to the head of the dorm. Trey Clover is the third-year Vice Housewarden. Cater Diamond is a third-Year, and Deuce Spade and Ace Troppla are first-years. Riddle's signature spell is called "Off With Your Head", which puts a collar around the person or people who gets hit by it's neck and prevents the victim from using any magic. Trey's signature spell is called "Paint the Roses" or "Doodle Suit" which allows him to change the properties, like taste, texture, color, and shape, of an item for a limited amount of time. Cater's signature spell is called "Split Card". If he uses it, he can create clones of himself that can act independantly. Deuce's signature spell is called  "Double Down" or "Bet the Limit". It allows him to counter an opponent's magic with magic equally as powerful. The stronger the opponent, the more power this spell gets. Ace's signature spell is "Joker Snatch", which allows him to temporarily use another person's signature spell. There are 810 rules in the Heartslabyul dorm, and an event that happens called "The Unbirthday Party", which happens when it is a day no one has a birthday. The Housewarden is very strict on the 810 rules, if you break one, it will be off with your head! </p>
        <p>The Next house is called Savannaclaw, which was Founded off the King of Beasts, Scar from the "Lion King", spirit of persistence. This house consists of three main characters, Leona Kingscholar, Ruggie Bucchi (Pronounced ROO-ghee BOO-chee), and Jack Howl. Leona Kingscholar is the third-year Housewarden who is a Lion beastman. The term "Beastman" is used to identify those who are part animal, part Human. Ruggie Bucchi is the second-year Heyna Beastman who is not officially a vice housewarden. Jack Howl is a first-year wolf Beastman. Leona's signature spell is called "The King's Roar". This makes whatever he touches turn to sand and dust.

Savannaclaw has students that excell in sporting events like Spelldrive and Track & Field. </p>
        <p> The third house is named Octavinelle. Octavinelle (Pronounced OCK-tuh-vin-ELL)was founded off the Sea Witch's, Ursula from "The Little Mermaid", spirit of benevolence. This house also has three main students, all second-years, Azul Ashengrotto, Jade Leech, and Floyd Leech. The Housewarden is Azul Ashengrotto, who is an octopus-merman. Jade Leech is the Vice Housewarden, who is an eel-merman. Floyd Leech is Jade's twin brother and also an eel-merman. Azul's signature spell is called 'It's a Deal!" which disables an ability or talent from anyone who signs a contract with him. Jade's signature spell is called "Shock the Heart", which forces the target to speak the truth if they look into his left eye. Floyd's signature spell is called "Bind the Heart", which interferes with the target's magic, causing the attack to miss. The Ocavinelle dormitory is very unique because it is the only dormatory that is fully underwater, which allows the students to turn into their mermaid/merman form when they are inside their dorm. The students of Octavinelle run a student buessness called "The Mostro Lounge", which is basically a small cafe on in the dorm.</p>
        <p>The fourth house is known as Scarabia, founded on the Sorcerer of the Sands's, Jafar from "Aladin", spirit of mindfulness. This house only has two main characters, Kalim Al-Asim (pronounced Kah-leem Al-Ah-SEEM) and Jamil Viper (pronounced Jah-meal). Kalim Al-Asim is a second-year Housewarden, with Jamil Viper as his Vice Housewarden. Kalim's signature spell is called "Oasis Maker", which summons a large ammount of fresh water, usually in rain from, to create a body of water. Jamil's signature spell is called "Snake Charmer" (also known as "Snake Whisper"), which hypnotizes the target and allows the user to control it. Scarabia students usually excell in studies like Astrology and Ancient Incantations.</p>
        <p>The next house is called Pomefiore (Pronounced Pom-free-ray), founded off of the Fairest Queen's, the Evil Queen from "Snow White and the Seven Drawfs, spirit of tenacity and beauty. This house has three main cast members, Vil Schoenheit (Pronounced VIL SHURN-hite), Rook Hunt, and Epel Felmier (Pronounced EH-pel FELL-meer). Vil Schoenheit is the Housewarden who is a third-year.

Vil's Signature spell is called "the Fairest of Them All", which places a curse on a person or object with custon conditions. Rook's signature spell is named "Arrow Afar", but it is also known as "I see you", which locates an object or person he has tagged. Epel's signature spell is called "Sleep Kiss" or "Crimson Slumber", which puts the target in a glass coffin and forces them into a deep sleep. People in Pomefiore usually excell in Potionology (the study of Potions) and focus on their looks. There is a Song and Dance tornement between the NRC and the RSA where Pomefiore usually makes it to the championships.</p>
        <p>The sixth house is named Ignihyde (Pronounced Ig-nee-hide), that is founded off the Watchman of the Underworld, Hades from "Hercules", spirit of diligence. This dorm houses two brothers, Idia Shroud and Ortho Shroud. Idia Shroud is the third-year, tech-savy, housewarden. Ortho Shroud is a robot-humanoid that Idia had built in place of his late brother. Idia's signature spell was passed down from his family. It is called "Gate to the Underworld", which allows him to open and close the gate to the Underworld. Ortho does not have a signature spell due to the fact that he is a robot-huminoid and not fully human. People in Ignihyde usually excell in Technology and Magical Engineering. Students of Ignihyde specialize with non magical technology. Ignihyde is one of the two houses without an official housewarden. This is because Ortho, the one who would probably be vice housewarden, is not an official student in Night Raven Collage. </p>
        <p>The final house is known as Diasomnia (pronounced Dee-yuh-som-nia), which was founded on the Thorn Fairy's, Maleficent from "Sleeping Beauty", spirit of nobility.

        <p>Ensemble Stars is an Anime/Manga/Game, also known as enstars. The game and Manga was made by the japanese company called Happy Elements, and the anime was made by  David Production (who is known for "JoJo's Bazarre Adventure"). The story takes place at Yumenosaki Private Academy, an all boys school for idols. Each Idol is part of a group called a unit. Yumenosaki Private Academy has four different productions within it. 
        <p>The first production is called Starmaker Production, also known as Star Pro, which is known for its "warm, big family" atmosphere and the principle of "Creating Happiness both for Fans and Idols". Star Pro was founnded by an Idol, Eichi Tenshouin, and is characterized by a large cast of idols, aiming to make idols a common part of life. Star Pro is home to units like Fine, RYUSEITAI (pronounced RYOO-say-tie), Trickstar, and ALKALOID (Pronounced al-kuh-loyd).The second production is called Cosmic Production, also known as Cospro, is known for "a meritocratic and high-pressure environment" and their slogan is "Reaching the Crescendo in Entertainment". Cospro is co-operated by Reimei and Shuetsu Academies. Cospro houses units like Eden, Valkyrie, 2wink, and Crazy:B.The next production is called Rhythm Link, but it is also called RhythLin. RhythLin is a "time-honored, modest-sized office" that is porteyed by their vast range of groups. From creative singers to bands, RhythLin has more than just traditional idols. RhythLin manages groups like UNDEAD, Ra*bits, and AKATSUKI. Their motto is "Communicating Souls with Music." The last production is called New Dimension, also known as NewDi. NewDi is, as in the name, a newer production. It focuses on expanding the definition of an Idol. This production oversees units like Knights, Switch, MaM, and Double Face. There is also a rival entertainment company that has MELLOW DEAR US and 4piece.</p>
        <p>The first unit that will be covered in fine. Fine was origanally a "Student Council" unit created by Eichi Tenshouin to compete and defeat the Five Eccentrics during the Yumenosaki War. After the origonal unit was disbanded, Eichi rebuilt it with Wataru Hibiki, Tori Himemiya, and Yuzuru Fushimi.</p>
        <p>The second one is called Trickstar. Trickstar was formed by four first-year students, who met at the Venus Cup. These students were Subaru, Hokuto, Makoto, and Mao. They bonded after preforming together and ended up staying a unit to revolutionize the school.</p>
        <p>This unit is known as RYUSEITAI. RYUSEITAI is a traditional "school-based" unit, and keeps its status as the oldest unit in the school. Each member of RYUSEITAI has a signature "Meteor" (RYUSEI) color and a unique catchphrase they use during their performances. Morisawa Chiaki ended up "reviving" the unit and dreamed of become a true hero, known as RYUSEI Red. Chiaki grew up as a "sickly child" who gained strength from tokusatsu shows, which is where his love for heroes sparked. He is incredibly self-sacrificing. It is not uncommon for him to protect his teammates by taking the blame for their mistakes. In school, he is sometimes known as the "Hero of Justice." Kanata Shinkai is a former member of the Five Eccentrics, known as RYUSEI Blue. He is "mysterious, water-loving sinior". He is eccentric and slow-paced and usually uses metaphores in life that relates to sea creatures. His signature phrase is "Puka Puka," meaning floating. Kanata grew up in a cult, known as a "god", Chiaki later helped him "become human" and live a normal life, but he still doesn't understand all human customs. Tetora Nagumo, RYUSEI Black, is the "hardworking muscle and designated successor" of Chiaki. He is a "earnest and traditional" person, aiming to be come a "man amoung men". He looks up to Kuro Kiryu from Akatsuki, and wanted to become a member of Akatsuki. He was rejected because they wanted to "protect an innocent child" from the darker side of their unit. He first struggled as RYUSEI Black, origonally wanting to be RYUSEI Red. Midori Taakamine, RYUSEI Green, is the "The tall, reluctant 'accident.'" Midori is perpetually depressed and unmotivated. He accidently applied to the idol course, thinking it would be a normal school. He loves Yuru-chara, mascots, and finds Chiaki's energy exhausting. Despite his complaints, he is very talented and cares for his teammates. Lastly, is Shinobu Sengoku, RYUSEI Yellow, who is the "The shy, ninja-obsessed specialist" of RYUSEITAI. He loves anything ninja related, and joined the ,once empty, Ninja Association. He has a "frog in a well" complex and can be fairly lonely, but found belonging in RYUSEITAI, where his "weird quirks and interests" were fully inbraced. At the start of the time line in Ensemble Stars, RYUSEITAI was lead by Morisawa Chiaki, then known as RYUSEITAI-M (M for Morisawa) By the end of the time line in Ensemble Stars, this unit was lead by one of its old junior members, Tetora Nagumo, known as RYUSEITAI-N (N for Nagumo).</p>

        <p>This series is about orphans being nursed in a orphanage in a socluted area that is blocked off by fences and walls. They are tested as a "substitute for school designed to prepare them for their future lives in the outside world."" The orphans are nursed until they are smart enough, then they get shipped off to a new home... wait... I'm on the wrong script, sorry.</p>
        <h3>By the way, this is major spoiler territory, if you wish to go on, be my guest, but if you want to read/watch it, visit it first, then come back.</h3>
        <p>What this is really about, is orphans being raised in a, what seems to be, nice orphanage, but if they score high enough on their test, they will be shipped off and eaten by demons. The age they are usually shipped off is 12, because that is the prime age for a brain's quality. Emma, an energetic 11-year old, Norman, an 11-year old math prodigy, and Ray, an 11-year old walking encyclopedia, are almost in their prime. Emma and Norman watch one of their friends be taken to her new home. But she left her leaving gift! As Emma and Norman go to give it back to her, they watch dead boyd being taken away by demons. Now they will have to rely on themselves, and Ray to let everyone escape. But their caretaker made it even harder, installing trackers in each child's ear at birth, and hiring a new nanny to keep watch. Will they be able to escape into the world? Will they ever be safe?</p>

        <p>Shugo Chara is an Anime and a Manga. The Manga was made by the duo Peach-Pit. The Animated Series was produced by Satelight. Shugo Chara is about a shy elementry girl named Amu Hinamori, who wishes to find her true self. In return, she finds three magical "Guardian Characters",Ran, Miki, and Su, that helps her find her true self and fight the evil forces. It is fairly hard to explain the entire plot, but I do recommend it to anime and manga newcomers.</p>
